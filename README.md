## General Information
  - A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
- We need to construct a model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
- US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes can focus more on Temperature.
- Summer and winter seasons are having good positive correlation with bike rentals.
- Spring season has negative coefficients and negatively correlated to bike rentals. May be some actions should be taken in this time by giving some offers in order to increase the demand.
- Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist and Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds has negative coefficients and negative correlation with count (target variable). So we may need to provide some offers in order to increase the demand on this climatic conditions.
- We can observe that demand for bikes got increased in 2019 when compared to 2018. This might be due to bike sharing system is gaining popularity year after year. We may observe some dip in bike rentals in 2020 and 2021 but these years are exceptional cases becuase of COVID pandemic conditions. But in general we an expect the raise in demand year after year.
